W11 Exercise: Assignment 11

Objectives
This assignment will give students practice in the following: 
* Using primitive data types and operators
* Using Methods
* Designing and creating your own classes that use inheritance and polymorphism
* Using an ArrayList
Overview
* Task: Complete the programming exercise.
* Instructor: Grades and provides feedback.
Instructions
Design a parent class named Employee. Your Employee class should include:
1. A String, name,  that holds the employee's name.
2. an integer serialNumber, that holds the employee's serial number.
3. A no-arg constructor that initializes name to "none" and serialNumber to 0.
4. A parameterized constructor that initializes name and serialNumber using arguments passed to the constructor.
5. Getters for name and serialNumber.
6. A method named getGrossPay( ) that returns a zero;
7. A method named getFedWithholding( ) that returns a zero.
8. A method named getStateWithholding( ) that returns a zero.
Design a class named Hourly that inherits from Employee. Your Hourly class should include:
1. A double, hourlyWage,  that holds this person's hourly wage.
2. A double, hoursWorked, that holds the number of hours this person worked.
3. An appropriate no-arg constructor.
4. An appropriate parameterized constructor.
5. Getters for hourlyWage and hoursWorked. 
6. OVERRIDE the getGrossPay( ), getFedWithholding( ) and getStateWithholding( ) methods from the Employee class. The gross pay for an Hourly employee is calculated as hoursWorked x hourlyWage. Use a state tax rate of 0.07 and a federal tax rate of 0.15.
Design a class named Salaried that inherits from Employee. Your Salaried class should include:
1. A double, annualSalary, that holds the annual salary for this person.
2. An appropriate no-arg constructor.
3. An appropriate parameterized constructor.
4. A Getter for salary. 
5. Override the getGrossPay( ), getFedWithholding( ) and getStateWithholding( ) methods from the Employee class. The gross pay for an Hourly employee is calculated as annualWage / 52. Use a state tax rate of 0.07 and a federal tax rate of 0.15.
Create a UML diagram that documents your class design. Show the Employee, Hourly and Salaried classes in your diagram. Include your diagram when you submit your assignment. The preferred format is a .PDF file.
Create a new project in IntelliJ and add the code for your Employee class, your Hourly class, and your Salaried class. Then create a driver class that contains your main( ) method. Your main( ) method should do the following:
1. Tells the user what the program does.
2. Creates an ArrayList<Employee>.
3. Create instances for the following employees and add them to the ArrayList:
   * Hourly employee Harry Hacker, serial number 123. Harry earns $15.00 and hour and works 30 hours a week.
   * Hourly employee Isabel Intern, serial number 233. Isabel earns $12.50 and hour and works 20 hours a week.
   * Salaried employee Cathy Coder, serial number 611. Cathy earns $80,000 a year.
4. Using an appropriate loop to go through the Employees in the ArrayList, print out a payroll report as shown in the following diagram:
5. Display a goodbye message.
The example below shows what the output from your program should look like:
Payroll Report
Employee: Harry Hacker Serial: 123
Gross Pay: $450.00
Federal Withholding: $67.50
State Withholding: $31.50
Net Pay: $351.00

Employee: Isabell Intern Serial: 233
Gross Pay: $250.00
Federal Withholding: $37.50
State Withholding: $17.50
Net Pay: $195.00

Employee: Catherine Coder Serial: 611
Gross Pay: $1,538.46
Federal Withholding: $230.77
State Withholding: $107.69
Net Pay: $1,200.00
Compile and test your code. When you are satisfied that your program works correctly, place the complete project folder for the
program into a zip file.  Add the UML file to the .zip file.
Submit the .zip file here on Canvas by the due date.
